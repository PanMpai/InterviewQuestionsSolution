# C#-interview-questions-solutions

For C# Questions, both Problem1 and Problem2 I created an .NET MVC Project. When the project starts you are going to see 2 buttons, 
the first one will trigger the code to run the code for Problem1 solution and the second one for the Problem2 solution. The input files are 
located in the input folder and the output folder is empty at first. When the code for each problem runs, the output file is generated and 
each one of them is saved in the output folder.

The SQL Questions solution queries are located in SQL folder.
